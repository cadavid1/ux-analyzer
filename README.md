## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **Backend**: Python with OpenAI API integration
- **Image Processing**: Pillow and OpenCV
- **Web Automation**: Selenium with Chrome WebDriver
- **AI Analysis**: OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini for intelligent evaluation

### Analysis Process
1. **Input Processing**: Handle uploaded files or capture website screenshots
2. **AI Analysis**: Send content to OpenAI API with structured prompts
3. **Result Processing**: Parse AI response into structured format
4. **Score Calculation**: Calculate category and overall scores
5. **Display**: Present results with rich visualizations

### Data Structure
The analysis results follow this structure:
```json
{
  "overall_score": 72,
  "summary": "Analysis summary...",
  "categories": {
    "01": {
      "title": "Category name",
      "score": 65,
      "checkpoints": {
        "01.01": {
          "text": "Checkpoint description",
          "status": "PASS|FAIL|ATTENTION",
          "reasoning": "AI reasoning",
          "recommendation": "Improvement suggestion"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "priority_issues": ["Issue 1", "Issue 2"],
  "strengths": ["Strength 1", "Strength 2"]
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Heuristics
1. Edit `ux_heuristics_structured.json`
2. Add new categories or checkpoints
3. Update the analysis prompts in `ux_analyzer.py`

### Styling
- Modify CSS in `app.py` to change appearance
- Update color schemes and layouts as needed

### AI Model
- Change the model in `ux_analyzer.py` (line 108)
- Adjust prompts for different analysis styles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Chrome Driver Issues**
- Ensure Chrome browser is installed
- WebDriver Manager handles driver installation automatically

**OpenAI API Errors**
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Check API quota and billing status
- Ensure model name is supported

**Memory Issues**
- Large video files may cause memory issues
- Consider reducing video resolution or length

**Slow Analysis**
- AI analysis can take 30-60 seconds
- Network speed affects processing time

### Error Messages
- **"Analysis failed: Error code: 400"**: Check OpenAI API configuration
- **"Screenshot capture failed"**: Website may block automated access
- **"File too large"**: Reduce file size or resolution
